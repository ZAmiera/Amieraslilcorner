            <h4>Howl's Moving Castle</h4>

              <p>That jumbled piece of architecture, that cacophony of hissing steam and creaking joints, with smoke billowing from it as it moves on its own... That castle is home to the magnificent wizard Howl, infamous for both his magical prowess and for being a womanizer—or so the rumor goes in Sophie Hatter's small town. Sophie, as the plain daughter of a hatmaker, does not expect much from her future and is content with working hard in the shop.</p>
              <p>However, Sophie's simple life takes a turn for the exciting when she is ensnared in a disturbing situation, and the mysterious wizard appears to rescue her. Unfortunately, this encounter, brief as it may be, spurs the vain and vengeful Witch of the Waste—in a fit of jealousy caused by a past discord with Howl—to put a curse on the maiden, turning her into an old woman.</p>
              <p>In an endeavor to return to normal, Sophie must accompany Howl and a myriad of eccentric companions—ranging from a powerful fire demon to a hopping scarecrow—in his living castle, on a dangerous adventure as a raging war tears their kingdom apart.</p>
            <h4>Cold Eyes</h4>

              <p>Ha Yoon-joo joins Hwang's police division. As soon as she joins the team, robbers rob the bank. However, because of the masks and skills, they cannot find any shreds of evidence. Meanwhile, James, the leader of the criminals, plans something else.</p>

          <h3>Series Recs</h3>
          <h4>Violet Evergarden</h4>

            <p>The Great War finally came to an end after four long years of conflict; fractured in two, the continent of Telesis slowly began to flourish once again. Caught up in the bloodshed was Violet Evergarden, a young girl raised for the sole purpose of decimating enemy lines. Hospitalized and maimed in a bloody skirmish during the War's final leg, she was left with only words from the person she held dearest, but with no understanding of their meaning.</p>
            <p>Recovering from her wounds, Violet starts a new life working at CH Postal Services after a falling out with her new intended guardian family. There, she witnesses by pure chance the work of an "Auto Memory Doll," amanuenses that transcribe people's thoughts and feelings into words on paper. Moved by the notion, Violet begins work as an Auto Memory Doll, a trade that will take her on an adventure, one that will reshape the lives of her clients and hopefully lead to self-discovery.</p>
          <h4>Hospital Playlist</h4>

            <p>Everyone knows that most hospitals are boring, but this isn't the case. This hospital is calming but exciting. Why is this hospital exciting, you may ask. Well, it's because of 5 doctors who make the boring hospital halls into colorful mall-like halls! They've been friends ever since they were in med school, but thanks to their occupations as doctors, they're closer than ever! The friends decide to create a band, but this is a bit of a problem because the lead singer has little experience when it comes to singing. When she sings, she sounds like a dying goat! But even with her terrible singing, her friends still love her and they think that the band will work out!</p>
